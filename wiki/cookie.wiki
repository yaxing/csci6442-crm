There are 2 sets of cookies:

*basic:* basic information of a logged in user, including user_id and user_role.

*private:* private information of a logged in user, including user_name and user_pwd. _This cookie will not be set unless user select "remember me" or "remember my password"._

Instruction of {{{basic[user_role]}}}:

if the user is not a worker, then {{{$_COOKIE["basic"]["user_role"] == "account_person"}}}

if the user is a worker, then the user_role can indicate multiple roles for the worker using separator '::'

eg. {{{$_COOKIE["basic"]["user_role"] = "worker::dispatcher::sales_manager"}}}.

After get the cookie, the string needs to be interpreted.

*password*:

*in database: *{{{md5(m5d(pwd))}}}

*in cookie: *{{{md5(pwd)}}}
