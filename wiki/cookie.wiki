There are 2 sets of cookies:

<strong>basic:</strong> basic information of a logged in user, including user_id and user_role.

<strong>private:</strong> private information of a logged in user, including user_name and user_pwd. <strong>This cookie will only be set if user select "remember me" or "remember my password".</strong>

Instruction of "basic[user_role]":

if the user is a worker, then $_COOKIE["basic"]["user_role"] == "account_person"

if the user is a worker, then the user_role can indicate multiple roles for the worker using separator '::'
eg. $_COOKIE["basic"]["user_role"] = ''worker::dispatcher::sales_manager".

After get the cookie, the string needs to be interpreted.
